# Stock Sprint

A real-time multiplayer stock trading game for the classroom. Players compete to grow a virtual $10,000 portfolio by buying and selling stocks as live news events move the market — all from their phones while a host projects the game on screen.

---

## How It Works

1. A **host** creates a room and displays the room code (+ QR code) on a projector
2. **Players** join on their phones by entering the code at `/play`
3. The host starts the game — a simulated stock market runs in real time
4. **Breaking news headlines** fire every few seconds, moving specific stocks up or down
5. Players buy and sell across 4 stocks to maximise their portfolio value
6. When time runs out, the leaderboard is revealed with grades, badges, and trader titles
